# PiPad remote

A virtual mouse and keyboard for Raspbian. Source provided only for educational
purposes. This app is useless without the server component that should be run
as a daemon in the rpi. You can implement it on your own though by reversing
the `Remote` class. The protocol is fairly simple.
